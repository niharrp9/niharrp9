## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
Hello, everyone! My name is Nihar Ranjan Panda and I am from the eastern part of India. I was born and raised in a town beside Asia's largest brackish lagoon. However, I have been living in and around Delhi for the past five years. I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela.

After my graduation, I worked at IndianOil in the commercial division of India's largest government-owned refinery. I was looking after the capital procurement and material demand forecasting for various technical departments within the refinery. Moreover, I had the privilege of leading a team of four members looking after the whole procurement process which consists of managing tenders, conducting negotiations, and overseeing procurements worth $16 million. 

By enrolling in this course, I hope to acquire the much-needed soft skills that include technical communication, digital storytelling, and various leadership and presentation skills to excel in the field of data science.
