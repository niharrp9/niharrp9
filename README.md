## 👋 About Me
Hello, everyone! My name is Nihar Ranjan Panda and I am from the eastern part of India. I was born and raised in a town beside Asia's largest brackish lagoon. However, I have been living in and around Delhi for the past five years. I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela.

After my graduation, I worked at IndianOil in the commercial division of India's largest government-owned refinery. I was looking after the capital procurement and material demand forecasting for various technical departments within the refinery. Moreover, I had the privilege of leading a team of four members looking after the whole procurement process which consists of managing tenders, conducting negotiations, and overseeing procurements worth $16 million. 

Highly motivated and results-oriented professional with 4+ years of experience in capital procurement, trading strategies, and data science. Proven ability to lead teams, negotiate contracts, automate processes, and leverage data to drive strategic decision-making.
  
## 🎉 Fun Facts 
I have a passion for cooking, playing chess, and lifting weights. I also consider myself a geography whiz - I can recite all the countries and their capitals under 10 minutes 🤩.
